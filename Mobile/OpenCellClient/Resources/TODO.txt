- Mio A701;
- Using when no signal is available;
- Option to ignore towers when GPS is not available;
- Only add towers when GPS is 3D fixed;
- Prevent from beeing a battery killer...
- Allow screen off as mobiles uses to go;
- Maybe use adaptative querry. if on AC power, do as much as needed ; if
on battery, allow a power safe mode it could also be interesting doing as Googole maps does for sending
latitude position... more we move, quicker point should be checked...
- in a train at 300 km/h guess 1 second is not so quick as 1 sec when I walk in streets...
- then, if not moving, there is no real interest in pooling gps and so evey 5 secs...
- also, about quality, you may also consider HDOP for the GPS position,
as if in poor GPS Signal, position may be erroneous...
This is not directly your concernes, but could be interetsting to
share with OpenCellID team for example...
- You may also consider dropping if we goo too quick, as information
will not be clean. I could try that soon, as I used to use train here
and as it's sometimes TGV, 333 km/h is my max speed...
