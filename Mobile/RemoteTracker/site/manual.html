                     <a name="1"><b>What is this software?</b></a><BR><BR>
     This software is a very simple way to track your device when it was lost, stolen or
     if you want to use your device for security purpose to track your car, for example. There are 
     several utilities for RemoteTracker, use your imagination! But remember, that you can't 
     use RemoteTracker to track people without their approval.</b><BR>
     <a href="manual.html#top" class=whitelink>Top</a><br><br>
     
     <a name="2"><b>How does RemoteTracker?</b></a><br><br>
     RemoteTracker works intercepting formatted SMS (Text Message) sent from any mobile phone. If you want to know 
     where is your device, you have to use any other phone and send a SMS to your disappeared device.<BR><BR>
     The SMS you send should start by <b>RT#</b> (or <b>RT2#</b> for <a href=http://www.htc.com/europe/product/hd2/overview.html target=HTC class=whitelink>HTC HD2</a> users) 
     followed by some parameters listed later below. <u>HTC HD2 users MUST use rt2# instead of rt# because the method used to intercept messages does not work in this device</u>.<BR><BR>
     That SMS intercepted by RemoteTracker will have commands to let you control your device remotely. 
     There are basic and advanced commands. You will use them according to your knowledge.<BR><BR>
     After send a command, RemoteTracker will process the command and send an answer to your. This
     answer can be another SMS, an E-Mail or a file send to your FTP account, if you have one.<BR><BR>
     It's important to say: RemoteTracker works in silent mode. There is no interface when a command is processing.<BR>
     <a href="manual.html#top" class=whitelink>Top</a><br><br>
     
     <a name="3"><b>Rescue (Anti Kidnapping) Function, the TopSecret application</b></a><BR><BR>
     RemoteTracker can help you to preserv your own security. You can set up four mobile phones and four e-mails 
     to be used when you have problems and need help. Here you must type the information of your wife, mother, father or so.<BR><BR>
     In <b>Programs</b> you will find an application named <b>TopSecret</b>. After start this program you will
     be asked to type a password. This is a fake and you don't need to type anything. After 30 seconds, if you don't click
     in cancel, a pre-defined message will be sent to your four emergency mobile number and to your four emergency
     e-mails followed by your name and your current position based of your GPS information.<BR><BR>
     TopSecret is not enabled by default. To active that funcion you will need to check the <b>Options/Active TopSecret</b> option using
     the <b>Config</b> application.<BR>
     <a href="manual.html#top" class=whitelink>Top</a><br><br>
     
     <a name="3.1"><b>Stopping Emergency Messages (Stopping TopSecret)</b></a><BR><BR>
     TopSecret will send emergency message until you softreset your device. This is the only way to stop it.<BR>
     <a href="manual.html#top" class=whitelink>Top</a><br><br>
     
     <a name="4"><b>Remote Control, the RTRemote application</b></a><BR><BR>
     Also in <b>Programs</b> you will find the <b>RTRemote</b> application. This application has two objectives:<BR> <BR>
     1- Test RemoteTracker in your own device without pay for SMS;<BR><BR>
     2- Send commands to another SmartPhone with RemoteTracker without type SMS. RTRemote do it for your.<BR>
     <a href="manual.html#top" class=whitelink>Top</a><br><br>
     
     <a name="5"><b>SIM Card Change Protection</b></a><BR><BR>
     A great problem when you install a software like RemoteTracker is: if the SIM card was changed everything is lost!<BR><BR>
     No! Everytime your device starts the installed SIM card will be verified if it is a know or an unknow SIM card. You
     can set up to four know SIM cards. If someone install an unkown SIM card, you will receive messages alerting you about
     the change and you will know the new mobile number to let you keep tracking your device.<BR>
     <a href="manual.html#top" class=whitelink>Top</a><br><br>
     
     <a name="6"><b>Is RemoteTracker Safe?</B></a><BR><BR>
     RemoteTracker has some features to presert your security:<br><BR>
     <UL>
       <LI>SIM Card Change Protection;<BR>
       <LI>Hidden mode. RemoteTracked is not show in Uninstall Application list and it's moved to another folder;<br>
       <LI>Password. You can only uninstall RemoteTracker or answer a command after type/send the password. Warning: if you lose your password you can use the commands LOSTPASS and SECRET (see below) to retrieve it (see the <a href=faq.html#18 class=whitelink>FAQ</a>).<BR>
     </UL>     
     <a href="manual.html#top" class=whitelink>Top</a><br><br>
     
     <a name="7"><b>Configuring RemoteTracker</b></a><BR><BR>
     If you are reading this Help, probably you started the <b>Config</b> application in <b>Program</b> 
     folder. If not, please start this application.<BR>
     Click in <b>Menu</b> to see the itens you can config:<BR>
     
     <UL>

         <LI><b>Password</b>: you can set a password, a secret question and a secret answer. This is a very useful option because this password will be used to process a command, to enter <b>Config</b> and to uninstall RemoteTracker. Without a password anyone can control your device. The secret question/answer will be used with the commands LOSTPASS and SECRET to retrieve a lost password (see the <a href=faq.html#18 class=whitelink>FAQ</a>).<BR>
         <LI><b>E-Mail Cofiguration</b>: as described above, RemoteTracker can answer commands using e-mail. But you must setup an e-mail account to be used to send messages.<BR>
         <LI><b>GPS Attempts for GPS Commands</b>: any GPS commands will try to connect with satellites using the GPS radio. But, if your device is inside a building it can't connect. To prevent a battery draining RemoteTracker has a limit of attempts.<BR>
         <LI><b>Timeout for ELT/FLT Commands</b>: ELT/FLT are special GPS commands to record the track your device are doing and send a KMZ file to you by e-mail/FTP. This file can be opened in Google Earth.<BR>
         <LI><b>Define Alarm Sound</b>: you can chose a diferent sound file to be played when RemoteTracker process the ALARM command.<BR>

         <LI><b>GPS Configuration</b>: there are two ways to use your GPS: managed by Windows Mobile or Manually using COM port and Baud Rate selection.<BR>
         <LI><b>Hide RemoteTracker</b>: <u>this option once started can't be undone</u>. RemoteTracker will be moved to another folder and removed from <b>Program</b> folder and <b>Uninstall</b> list. Be sure use did the entire configurations before use this function.<BR>
       </UL>
       <LI><b>CellID to Coordinate Provider</b>: you can choose between three providers: OpenCellId (<a href=http://www.opencellid.org target=OpenCellID class=whitelink>http://www.opencellid.org</a>, default), Google Maps (unofficial) or 
              CellDB (<a href=http://www.celldb.org target=CellDB class=whitelink>http://www.celldb.org</a>). When you send a command to RemoteTracker to use some GPS feature, RemoteTracker will try to get the current position based on GPS information. But what happens if 
              there are no GPS signal or if your device does not have a GPS receiver? RemoteTracker will get the information about the cellular tower (CELLID) and send to one of that providers. They will answer the the coordinate of the tower. It's not so accurated as GPS, but
              it's better than nothing.<br>
       <LI><b>WEB</b>: This feature is not implemented yet.<BR>  
       <LI><b>SIM Cards</b>: you can set up to four known SIM cards. If you, or anyone, change the SIM card to an unknow card, your emergency number and e-mails will receive a message alerting you about the change and with the new number<BR>

     <UL>
       <LI><b>rt#</b> or <b>rt2#</b> are the headers. Windows Mobile will know it has to start RemoteTracker because the message starts with that headers. For this tutorial, we will say just the first, but both can be used. HD2 users MUST use rt2# because rt# does not work;<br>
       <LI><b>[command]</b> is the command to be processed. Please see the list below;<br>
       <LI><b>[mobile number or e-mail address]</b> this is optional. If the command will be answer by SMS, you can define the mobile phone to receive that answer.

If you leave it blank the default e-mail address will be used;<BR>
       <LI><b>[password]</b> this parameter is optional, but if you defined a password in Config application, so it will be mandatory.<BR>
       <LI><b>#</b> this character is the separator. You must type it to delimiter the parameters.<BR>
