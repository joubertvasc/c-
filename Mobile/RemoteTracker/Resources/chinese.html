     <b>What is this software?</b><BR><BR>
     This software is a very simple way to track your device when it was lost, stolen or
     if you want to use your device for security purpose to track your car, for example. There are 
     several utilities for RemoteTracker, use your imagination! But remember, that you can't 
     use RemoteTracker to track people without their approval.</b><BR><br>
     
     <b>How does RemoteTracker?</b><br><br>
     RemoteTracker works intercepting formatted SMS (Text Message) sent from any mobile phone. If you want to know 
     where is your device, you have to use any other phone and send a SMS to your disappeared device.<BR><BR>
     The SMS you send should start by <b>RT#</b> followed by some parameters listed later below.<BR><BR>
     That SMS intercepted by RemoteTracker will have commands to let you control your device remotely. 
     There are basic and advanced commands. You will use them according to your knowledge.<BR><BR>
     After send a command, RemoteTracker will process the command and send an answer to your. This
     answer can be another SMS, an E-Mail or a file send to your FTP account, if you have one.<BR><BR>
     It's important to say: RemoteTracker works in silent mode. There is no interface when a command is processing.<BR><BR>  
     
     <b>Rescue (Anti Kidnapping) Function</b><BR><BR>
     RemoteTracker can help you to preserv your own security. You can set up four mobile phones and four e-mails 
     to be used when you have problems and need help. Here you must type the information of your wife, mother, father or so.<BR><BR>
     In <b>Programs</b> you will find an application named <b>TopSecret</b>. After start this program you will
     be asked to type a password. This is a fake and you don't need to type anything. After 30 seconds, if you don't click
     in cancel, a pre-defined message will be sent to your four emergency mobile number and to your four emergency
     e-mails followed by your name and your current position based of your GPS information.<BR><BR>
     
     <b>Remote Control</b><BR><BR>
     Also in <b>Programs</b> you will find the <b>RTRemote</b> application. This application has two objectives:<BR> <BR>
     1- Test RemoteTracker in your own device without pay for SMS;<BR><BR>
     2- Send commands to another SmartPhone with RemoteTracker without type SMS. RTRemote do it for your.<BR><BR>
     
     <b>SIM Card Change Protection</b><BR><BR>
     A great problem when you install a software like RemoteTracker is: if the SIM card was changed everything is lost!<BR><BR>
     No! Everytime your device starts the installed SIM card will be verified if it is a know or an unknow SIM card. You
     can set up to four know SIM cards. If someone install an unkown SIM card, you will receive messages alerting you about
     the change and you will know the new mobile number to let you keep tracking your device.<BR><BR>
